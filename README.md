# Sicredi App Redesign
This redesign aims to modernize the current Sicredi/Sicredi X app, as the existing version contrasts with the image the company seeks to project through its marketing campaigns and architectural styles.

While the marketing and architectural departments are adopting a more modern, dynamic, vibrant, and streamlined approach, the application appears outdated, with its forms, colors, and layout reminiscent of an earlier era of the web.
